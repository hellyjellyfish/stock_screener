## _Goal_:
This is a simple project aimed to screen stocks based on fundamental and technical criteria.

## _Scope_:
To improve the ability of a user to screen US stocks at scale based off of certain critera that have strong fundamentals, along with the ability for the user to add technials (buy or sell opportunity).

For example, a user who screens and identifies a stock with a double bottom (i.e. pattern formed from two consecutive rounding bottoms, resembling a W shape) may indictate a potential reversal (and hence an opportunity to profit).
